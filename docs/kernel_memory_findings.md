# Kernel Memory Investigation Findings

## Executive Summary

**CORRECTED UNDERSTANDING**: Initially we thought QEMU was filtering kernel memory access, but this was wrong. All kernel structures ARE present and accessible in the memory-backend-file. The difference in our findings (17,151 false positives via mmap vs 1,068 real PTEs via QMP) was due to search methodology, not access restrictions. QEMU provides transparent access to all guest memory - the challenge is finding and identifying real kernel structures among 6GB of data.

## Key Findings

### 1. No Memory Protection - Just Hard Pattern Matching

- **memory-backend-file (`/tmp/haywire-vm-mem`)**: Contains ALL guest memory, unfiltered
- **QMP with `cpu_physical_memory_read()`**: Accesses the SAME memory
- **False positives**: Weak pattern matching found 17,151 PTE-like patterns (any 8 bytes with bits 0-1 = 0x3)
- **Real PTEs**: Targeted searching with validation found 1,068 actual page tables
- **Key insight**: Both access methods show identical data - the difference was search strategy, not access level

### 2. KPTI and Per-Process Page Tables (Why PGD/PUD are Missing)

Modern Linux kernels use **KPTI (Kernel Page Table Isolation)** as a security mitigation against Meltdown attacks. This fundamentally changes how page tables are organized:

#### KPTI Architecture on ARM64
- **TTBR0_EL1**: User-space translation table base register (per-process)
- **TTBR1_EL1**: Kernel-space translation table base register (shared)
- **Each process has its own PGD**: Not a single master page table
- **~219 separate PGD tables**: One per running process
- **Security benefit**: Prevents user-space from seeing kernel mappings

This explains why we couldn't find a single PGD or PUD - they're scattered across process control blocks (task_structs), with each process maintaining its own page table hierarchy.

### 3. Page Table Distribution

We found **1,068 real PTE tables** and **38 PMD tables** in guest RAM:

#### Level 3 (PTE) Tables - 1,068 total
- **846 tables** at `0x042000000-0x043ff0000` (64-96MB region)
- **222 tables** at `0x1003e1000-0x107fe9000` (3-4GB region)

#### Level 2 (PMD) Tables - 38 total
- **33 PMDs** in lower memory (64-96MB)
  - Example: PMD at `0x042d4f000` → points to 38 PTE tables
  - Example: PMD at `0x042a3f000` → points to 7 PTE tables
- **5 PMDs** in upper memory (4GB region)
  - Example: PMD at `0x100f4e000` → points to 10 PTE tables

#### Missing Levels (Now Explained)
- **Level 1 (PUD)**: Fragmented across ~219 process structures
- **Level 0 (PGD)**: Each process has its own, pointed to by task_struct→mm→pgd

### 4. Memory Regions Explored

| Region | Address Range | Contents Found |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| Below 16MB | `0x00000000-0x01000000` | Boot code, interrupt vectors, firmware pointers |
| Guest RAM start | `0x40000000-0x48000000` | Some user data, no kernel structures |
| Kernel code area | `0x48000000-0x50000000` | Kernel code, no page tables |
| **Lower PTEs** | `0x42000000-0x44000000` | **846 PTE tables + 33 PMDs** |
| 3GB region | `0xC0000000-0xF0000000` | Empty/sparse |
| **Upper PTEs** | `0x100000000-0x108000000` | **222 PTE tables + 5 PMDs** |
| Flash regions | `0x00000000-0x08000000` | UEFI firmware, boot structures |
| 6GB boundary | `0x180000000+` | Flash, ACPI tables |

### 5. Files Created for Analysis

| File | Size | Contents |
|------|------|----------|
| `/tmp/pte-region-lower-ptes-64-96MB.dump` | 32MB | ~846 page tables |
| `/tmp/pte-region-upper-ptes-4GB.dump` | 128MB | ~222 page tables |
| `/tmp/pte-region-ram-start.dump` | 16MB | Start of guest RAM |
| `/tmp/pte-region-kernel-code-area.dump` | 16MB | Kernel code region |
| `/tmp/memory-checkpoint.dump` | 4GB | Full memory checkpoint |

### 6. Key Discoveries

1. **No kernel isolation by QEMU**: All kernel structures are in the memory-backend-file
2. **QMP provides targeted access**: Our custom `expose-kernel-memory` command helps us search specific addresses
3. **Page tables ARE in guest RAM**: Scattered by SLUB allocator, hard to find but not hidden
4. **Partial hierarchy visible**: We can see PMD→PTE connections but not PUD→PMD or PGD→PUD
5. **Sequential mappings confirm real PTEs**: Real page tables map contiguous memory regions

### 7. What Makes a Real PTE

**Real PTEs have:**
- Valid bit set (bits 0-1 = 0x3)
- Sequential physical addresses (consecutive 4KB pages)
- Proper ARM64 attributes (AF bit, AP bits)
- Target addresses within guest RAM (0x40000000-0x180000000)

**False positives had:**
- Invalid target addresses (0x0, 0x00000f000, etc.)
- No sequential patterns
- Mixed with kernel pointers (0xffff...)
- No higher-level tables pointing to them

## Finding Per-Process Page Tables

With KPTI, page tables are per-process. To map them:

### 1. Locate Process Control Blocks (task_structs)
- Search for PID patterns at known offsets (0x4e8, 0x500, etc.)
- Verify with process name (comm field) at offsets 0x5c0-0x650
- Extract mm_struct pointer → leads to per-process PGD
- ~219 real processes vs 50k+ false positives found

### 2. Read CPU Registers Per Process
- TTBR0_EL1: Points to current process's user-space PGD
- TTBR1_EL1: Points to kernel PGD (shared across processes)
- Changes on context switch

### 3. Known Kernel Symbols Still Exist
- `swapper_pg_dir` - kernel's master page table (for kernel space)
- `init_mm.pgd` - initial/idle task page table
- `idmap_pg_dir` - identity-mapped tables for boot

### 4. Security Implications
- **SW_TTBR0_PAN**: Software Privileged Access Never
- Kernel cannot accidentally access user memory
- Each process isolated from others and kernel
- Makes forensics harder but security stronger

## Technical Notes

### ARM64 Page Table Format
```
Level 0 (PGD) → Level 1 (PUD) → Level 2 (PMD) → Level 3 (PTE) → Physical Page
    512 entries    512 entries    512 entries    512 entries    4KB page
```

### Why Finding Kernel Structures is Hard
The challenge isn't access restrictions but complexity:
1. **Pattern matching noise**: In 6GB, many byte sequences look like kernel structures
2. **SLUB scattering**: Dynamic allocation spreads structures across memory
3. **KPTI fragmentation**: ~200 separate page table hierarchies instead of one
4. **No index**: No master list of where structures are located
5. **Virtual addresses**: Kernel uses 0xffff... addresses requiring translation

## Investigation Methodology Lessons

### What Led to Initial Confusion
1. **Different search methods gave different results**:
   - Broad pattern matching via mmap: 17,151 matches
   - Targeted address searching via QMP: 1,068 real PTEs
   - Same data, different search strategies

2. **Weak patterns match too much**:
   - PTE pattern (bits 0-1 = 0x3): Too common in random data
   - PID pattern (1-65535): Matches many 2-byte sequences
   - Process names: Short strings appear randomly

3. **Assumed complexity where there was none**:
   - Thought QEMU was filtering access
   - Reality: QEMU just provides transparent RAM access

### Effective Approaches
1. **Ground truth validation**: Running scripts inside VM to get real process lists
2. **Targeted searching**: Looking at known addresses beats broad pattern matching
3. **Sequential validation**: Real PTEs map consecutive pages, false positives don't
4. **Cross-validation**: Compare multiple detection methods

## Conclusion

We've successfully located and mapped the majority of kernel page tables (PTEs and PMDs) in guest physical memory. The "missing" PGD/PUD tables are now explained: due to KPTI (Kernel Page Table Isolation), each of the ~219 processes maintains its own page table hierarchy. Instead of a single master page table, we have:

- **219 separate PGD tables**: One per process, pointed to by task_struct→mm→pgd
- **TTBR0/TTBR1 split**: User and kernel address spaces use separate translation table base registers
- **Security by design**: This fragmentation is intentional to prevent Meltdown attacks
- **No QEMU filtering**: All structures are in the memory-backend-file, just hard to find

To fully map the page tables, we need to:
1. Improve task_struct detection to reduce false positives (6,936 found via weak matching, only ~200 real)
2. Use ground truth from /proc inside VM for validation
3. Extract mm→pgd pointers from each valid task_struct
4. Follow each process's individual PGD→PUD→PMD→PTE hierarchy
5. Build tools that understand SLUB allocation patterns to find structures more reliably
